#### DERTERMINATION OF PREMIUM RATE IN A LIFE OFFICE OF AN INSURANCE COMPANY

### University of Lagos - Final Year Project.

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
This study aims at addressing the problem of fixing premium:
- In the absense of sufficient data (using conventional actuarial formulas)
- When there is sufficient data (using predictive analytics).

When there is sufficient data, these data are usually:
- Large and cannot be analysed manually
- Laying dormant and not being utilized as a result of the gap between
the insurance data science industry.


#### PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
Using predictive analytics to predict premium charges, this study also aims at addressing the problem of data utilization in the insurance industry. 
With the increase in the amount of data and advances in data analytics, the underwriting process in insurance firms can be automated for faster processing of applications.


> Using MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION model contained in Python's Scikit-Learn Module, for a new policy holder, given a set of input (ie our features/independent variables), insurance charges (i.e our response/dependent variable) is being determined.

Decisions can be made in a life office on the amount of premium to charge by Predictive Analytics which involves the use of modeling and data analysis techniques on large data sets (of information or gotten from past and existing policy holders) to discover predictive patterns and relationships useful for fixing premium charges.
